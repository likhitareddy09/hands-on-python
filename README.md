# hands-on-python 🐍

This repository contains Python practice programs and hands-on exercises.
It focuses on writing clean code, validating user inputs, and testing programs
using predefined test cases.

## 📌 Project: User Profile Validation

This Python program validates user profile details based on given constraints
and prints whether the user profile is **VALID** or **INVALID**.

---

## ✅ Validation Rules

- **Full Name** must contain at least two words (first name and last name)
- **Email** must:
  - Contain exactly one `@`
  - Contain at least one `.`
  - Not start with `@`
- **Mobile Number** must:
  - Contain exactly **10 digits**
  - Contain only numbers
  - Not start with `0`
- **Age** must be between **18 and 60**

**Input**
- Full Name: Yasir Afaq  
- Email: yasir@gmail.com  
- Mobile: 9622949937
